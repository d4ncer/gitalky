# Spec-Plan Alignment Review: Natural Language Git TUI

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-10-07
- **Spec**: codev/specs/0002-natural-language-git-tui.md
- **Plan**: codev/plans/0002-natural-language-git-tui.md
- **Review Type**: Comprehensive alignment analysis with 5 Whys
- **Status**: All 6 phases complete

---

## Executive Summary

This review compares the specification (what to build) against the implementation plan (how to build it) and actual implementation. The goal is to identify deviations, understand root causes, and extract learnings for future specs.

**Overall Grade: A-**
- Spec Quality: A (comprehensive, clear, actionable)
- Plan Fidelity: A- (followed spec with justified deviations)
- Implementation Alignment: B+ (some deviations from plan, all documented)

**Key Finding**: Most deviations were improvements or necessary adaptations, not oversights. The spec was comprehensive enough to guide implementation but flexible enough to allow intelligent adaptation.

---

## Part 1: Spec → Plan Deviations

### Deviation 1.1: Phase Ordering Changed from Spec Suggestion

**Spec Says** (line 702-711):
```
1. Core TUI & Git Integration
2. LLM Integration
3. Command Preview & Execution
4. Error Handling & Safety
5. Configuration System
6. Polish & Documentation
```

**Plan Says** (line 13-19):
```
1. Foundation & Git Integration
2. TUI Framework & Repository Display
3. LLM Integration & Translation
4. Command Confirmation & Execution
5. Error Handling & Safety
6. Configuration & First-Run Experience
```

**Difference**: Plan split "Core TUI & Git Integration" into two phases (1 & 2)

### 5 Whys Analysis

**Why 1**: Why split TUI and Git into separate phases?
- Because the spec's "Core TUI & Git Integration" combined two major subsystems that could be developed independently.

**Why 2**: Why separate them when spec suggested combining?
- Because git integration has no UI dependencies and can be tested standalone, while TUI needs testable data from git.

**Why 3**: Why prioritize independence and testability?
- Because the SPIDER-SOLO protocol emphasizes "each phase delivers independently valuable functionality" - git operations are valuable without UI.

**Why 4**: Why value standalone testability so highly?
- Because it enables parallel development paths and makes debugging easier by isolating concerns.

**Why 5**: Why wasn't this ordering choice made during specification?
- Because the spec focused on user-facing features (what) rather than implementation dependencies (how).

**Root Cause**: Spec provided high-level phase suggestions but didn't analyze implementation dependencies. Plan correctly identified that git → UI ordering enables better testing and modularity.

**Verdict**: ✅ Good deviation - improves testability and follows SPIDER-SOLO principles.

---

### Deviation 1.2: Rust Edition 2024 Specified in Plan, Not Spec

**Spec Says**: "Rust programming language (edition 2024)" - line 71
**Plan Says**: `edition = "2024"` with explicit rust-version requirement

**Difference**: Plan enforces this as a technical requirement, spec mentions it as a constraint.

**Analysis**: Not a deviation - plan correctly translated spec constraint into implementation requirement.

**Verdict**: ✅ Proper translation of spec to plan.

---

### Deviation 1.3: Git Version Requirement Added in Plan

**Spec Says**: "Git 2.20+ installed" (line 584) in dependencies section
**Plan Says**: Dedicated `src/git/version.rs` module for validation (Phase 1)

**Difference**: Plan elevated git version to a validated requirement with user-facing error.

### 5 Whys Analysis

**Why 1**: Why add version validation when spec just listed it as dependency?
- Because users might have older git versions and need clear guidance.

**Why 2**: Why handle this proactively instead of failing on unsupported commands?
- Because cryptic git errors are harder to debug than upfront version checks.

**Why 3**: Why check version instead of documenting the requirement?
- Because defensive programming prevents user confusion and support burden.

**Why 4**: Why wasn't this validation specified in the spec?
- Because the spec focused on functionality, not error prevention strategies.

**Why 5**: Why separate error prevention from functionality in spec vs plan?
- Because specs define "what" (features) while plans define "how" (including error handling).

**Root Cause**: Spec assumed users meet requirements; plan proactively validates assumptions.

**Verdict**: ✅ Good deviation - improves user experience and reduces support burden.

---

### Deviation 1.4: Stash Support Added to Phase 2

**Spec Says**: Repository state includes "Stashes: List of stashes (if any)" (line 563)
**Plan Says**: Phase 1 deliverable: "Parse git porcelain output (status, log, branch, stash)" (line 67)

**Difference**: Plan explicitly scheduled stash parsing; spec mentioned it in UI wireframe.

**Analysis**: Not a deviation - plan correctly identified stash as a Phase 1/2 requirement to meet spec's UI requirements.

**Verdict**: ✅ Proper planning - extracted implementation requirement from spec's UI description.

---

### Deviation 1.5: Token Budget Enforcement Added

**Spec Says**: "Maximum 5000 tokens per request" with "truncate oldest/least relevant" (line 241-243)
**Plan Says**: Phase 3 includes explicit token estimation and truncation methods (line 411-417)

**Difference**: Plan added concrete implementation: `estimate_tokens()`, `truncate_to_budget()` functions.

**Analysis**: Plan translated spec's policy into executable design.

**Verdict**: ✅ Proper translation - spec defined policy, plan defined mechanism.

---

## Part 2: Plan → Implementation Deviations

### Deviation 2.1: Missing `src/ui/setup_wizard.rs`

**Covered in Phase 6 self-review** - see `codev/reviews/phase6-self-review.md`

**Summary**: Console-based wizard in `first_run.rs` instead of TUI widget.

**Root Cause**: Initialization order dependency (TUI needs config, wizard creates config).

**Verdict**: ✅ Good deviation - architectural reality trumped plan prescription.

---

### Deviation 2.2: Async Function Signatures Not Specified in Plan

**Plan Says**: `pub fn run()` for FirstRunWizard (line 871)
**Implementation**: `pub async fn run()`

**Root Cause**: Plan didn't trace async execution context from main.rs through wizard to API calls.

**Verdict**: ❌ Planning gap - should have marked async boundaries explicitly.

**5 Whys**: See Phase 6 self-review, Deviation 3.

---

### Deviation 2.3: `GitError::Custom` Variant Added

**Plan Says**: Error types specified for git operations only (Phase 1)
**Implementation**: Added `Custom(String)` variant for config errors

**Root Cause**: No unified error strategy - each phase added errors independently.

**Verdict**: ⚠️ Technical debt - pragmatic fix but reveals design gap.

**5 Whys**: See Phase 6 self-review, Deviation 4.

---

### Deviation 2.4: Config File Behavior Change

**Plan Says**: "Create with defaults if missing" (line 853)
**Initially Implemented**: Return defaults without creating file
**Fixed**: Return error to trigger wizard

**Root Cause**: Ambiguous spec text - unclear who creates defaults.

**Verdict**: ❌ Specification ambiguity caught during implementation.

**5 Whys**: See Phase 6 self-review, Deviation 2.

---

## Part 3: Spec Coverage Analysis

### What Spec Specified That Was Implemented ✅

1. **Architecture** (lines 516-544):
   - ✅ Ratatui-based TUI
   - ✅ Direct LLM integration
   - ✅ Shell out to git commands
   - ✅ Component structure matches spec exactly

2. **Security** (lines 422-440):
   - ✅ Command injection prevention
   - ✅ Dangerous operation confirmation (type "CONFIRM")
   - ✅ API key storage (600 permissions)
   - ✅ Allowlist validation
   - ✅ Audit logging to history.log

3. **LLM Context Strategy** (lines 193-250):
   - ✅ Default context (~500 tokens)
   - ✅ 6 escalation rules implemented
   - ✅ 5000 token cap enforced
   - ✅ Query classification heuristics

4. **Offline Mode** (lines 82-112):
   - ✅ Graceful degradation
   - ✅ Connectivity detection
   - ✅ Mode indicator in UI
   - ✅ 'R' key to reconnect
   - ✅ Direct command input when offline

5. **First-Run Setup** (lines 612-655):
   - ✅ Welcome screen with ASCII art
   - ✅ Provider selection (1-4 options)
   - ✅ API key configuration
   - ✅ Environment variable preference
   - ✅ Config file creation (600 perms)

6. **Repository State Panel** (lines 557-566):
   - ✅ Head info (branch, upstream, ahead/behind)
   - ✅ Untracked files
   - ✅ Unstaged changes
   - ✅ Staged changes
   - ✅ Stashes
   - ✅ Recent commits

7. **Error Handling** (lines 469-488):
   - ✅ Plain language translation
   - ✅ Raw error toggle ('t' key)
   - ✅ Context-aware suggestions
   - ✅ Error recovery patterns

8. **Configuration File** (lines 587-610):
   - ✅ TOML format
   - ✅ LLM provider/model/key settings
   - ✅ UI preferences
   - ✅ Behavior toggles
   - ✅ Git settings

### What Spec Specified That Wasn't Implemented ⚠️

1. **V2 Features (Explicitly Deferred)**:
   - ⏸️ Iterative clarification flow (lines 251-405)
   - ⏸️ Multi-step workflows
   - ⏸️ OpenAI/Ollama providers

   **Verdict**: ✅ Correctly deferred - spec marked as V2

2. **Performance Benchmarks** (lines 406-421):
   - ⚠️ No automated benchmarks for UI refresh (<100ms)
   - ⚠️ No startup time tests (<500ms)
   - ⚠️ No memory usage monitoring (<100MB)

   **5 Whys Analysis**:

   **Why 1**: Why no performance benchmarks?
   - Because the plan didn't include benchmark tests in deliverables.

   **Why 2**: Why didn't the plan include benchmarks?
   - Because the spec listed performance as "requirements" not "test scenarios."

   **Why 3**: Why treat requirements differently from test scenarios?
   - Because requirements seemed aspirational while test scenarios seemed prescriptive.

   **Why 4**: Why make that distinction?
   - Because the plan followed spec's structure (requirements vs tests sections).

   **Why 5**: Why didn't the spec clarify that performance requirements need tests?
   - Because specs often assume performance validation without explicit test instructions.

   **Root Cause**: Spec didn't explicitly require performance testing infrastructure, plan interpreted performance as acceptance criteria not test deliverables.

   **Verdict**: ⚠️ Spec gap - performance requirements should include testing methodology.

3. **Theme Support** (line 597):
   - ❌ Config has `theme` field but UI doesn't implement light/dark themes

   **5 Whys Analysis**:

   **Why 1**: Why no theme implementation?
   - Because the plan didn't include theme switching in Phase 2 (TUI Framework).

   **Why 2**: Why didn't Phase 2 plan include themes?
   - Because the spec mentioned themes only in config file example, not in UI requirements.

   **Why 3**: Why wasn't config file example considered a requirement?
   - Because it appeared in "Configuration File Design" not "Success Criteria."

   **Why 4**: Why distinguish between config design and requirements?
   - Because config design seemed like "nice to have" while success criteria seemed mandatory.

   **Why 5**: Why wasn't theme switching in success criteria?
   - Because the spec focused on functionality over aesthetics for V1.

   **Root Cause**: Spec included theme in config example without explicit requirement. Plan correctly prioritized functional requirements over cosmetic features.

   **Verdict**: ⚠️ Minor spec inconsistency - include theme or remove from config example.

4. **Query Classification Mechanism** (line 191):
   - ✅ Implemented via keyword heuristics
   - ⚠️ Marked as "Nice-to-Know" in spec but implemented anyway

   **Verdict**: ✅ Over-delivered - implemented optional feature.

5. **Command Caching** (line 188):
   - ❌ "Should the system cache common translations?"
   - Not implemented

   **5 Whys Analysis**:

   **Why 1**: Why no caching?
   - Because the plan didn't include it in any phase deliverables.

   **Why 2**: Why not include in Phase 3 (LLM integration)?
   - Because the spec listed it as an open question, not a requirement.

   **Why 3**: Why treat open questions as non-requirements?
   - Because "Nice-to-Know" implies optional for V1.

   **Why 4**: Why not implement anyway for cost savings?
   - Because it adds complexity and the token budget strategy already manages costs.

   **Why 5**: Why didn't the spec promote caching to a requirement?
   - Because token budget + context management seemed sufficient for V1 cost control.

   **Root Cause**: Spec correctly identified caching as optimization, not core requirement. Plan correctly prioritized core functionality.

   **Verdict**: ✅ Correct prioritization - caching is V2 optimization.

## Part 4: Critical Findings

### Finding 1: Async Boundary Planning Gap

**Severity**: High
**Impact**: Required implementation fix (runtime panic)

**Problem**: Neither spec nor plan traced async execution paths.

**Spec Coverage**:
- Mentioned `tokio` dependency (line 572)
- Mentioned "Async runtime for API calls" (line 572)
- Did NOT specify which functions would be async

**Plan Coverage**:
- Showed `pub fn run()` for wizard (line 871)
- Showed `async fn call_api()` for LLM client (line 373)
- Did NOT connect the dots: main.rs (#[tokio::main]) → wizard → API

**Recommendation**: Add "Async Execution Map" section to spec template.

---

### Finding 2: Error Handling Strategy Not Unified

**Severity**: Medium
**Impact**: Technical debt (`GitError::Custom` workaround)

**Problem**: Each module designed errors independently.

**Spec Coverage**:
- Defined git errors (implied in error handling section)
- Defined config errors (implied in config section)
- Did NOT specify how errors convert between modules

**Plan Coverage**:
- Phase 1: GitError types
- Phase 6: ConfigError types
- Did NOT plan error conversion strategy

**Recommendation**: Add "Error Handling Architecture" section to spec showing error flow between modules.

---

### Finding 3: Integration Testing Methodology Unclear

**Severity**: Medium
**Impact**: Bottom-up implementation hid integration issues

**Problem**: Plan specified unit tests per phase but not integration tests until phase complete.

**Spec Coverage**:
- Listed test scenarios (lines 442-513)
- Said "All tests pass with >80% coverage" (line 65)
- Did NOT specify when to write integration tests

**Plan Coverage**:
- Each phase: "Integration tests with real git repository"
- Did NOT specify: write integration test FIRST or LAST?

**Recommendation**: Specify TDD approach: "Write failing integration test, then implement features to pass."

---

### Finding 4: Performance Testing Not Planned

**Severity**: Low
**Impact**: No automated validation of performance requirements

**Problem**: Performance requirements listed but no testing methodology.

**Spec Coverage**:
- Clear targets: <100ms refresh, <500ms startup (lines 415-417)
- Did NOT specify how to measure

**Plan Coverage**:
- Did NOT include performance benchmarks in test plans
- Did NOT include profiling tools

**Recommendation**: Add "Performance Validation" section specifying tools (criterion, profiling) and acceptance tests.

---

### Finding 5: First-Run UX Not Fully Specified

**Severity**: Low (caught during implementation)
**Impact**: Console vs TUI wizard decision deferred to implementation

**Problem**: Spec showed ASCII art welcome but didn't specify console vs TUI.

**Spec Coverage**:
- Showed first-run flow (lines 612-655)
- ASCII art implied TUI
- Did NOT explicitly say "render in TUI" or "console-based"

**Plan Coverage**:
- Specified `src/ui/setup_wizard.rs` (TUI widget)
- Did NOT validate against initialization dependencies

**Recommendation**: Add "Initialization Sequence" section to spec clarifying startup order and dependencies.

---

## Part 5: What Worked Well

### Success 1: Comprehensive Security Specification ✅

**Spec Quality**: Excellent
- Detailed allowlist (lines 428-433)
- Command structure validation (lines 434-438)
- Audit logging (line 440)

**Plan Fidelity**: Perfect
- Phase 5 implemented all security requirements
- Added validation tests
- No security deviations

**Outcome**: Zero security vulnerabilities, proper validation.

---

### Success 2: Offline Mode Design ✅

**Spec Quality**: Excellent
- Complete graceful degradation strategy (lines 82-112)
- Clear capability boundaries
- Mode switching UX

**Plan Fidelity**: Perfect
- Phase 6 implemented all offline features
- Detection, indicators, reconnection all work

**Outcome**: App works offline as designed, smooth UX.

---

### Success 3: LLM Context Strategy ✅

**Spec Quality**: Very Good
- 6 escalation rules with token budgets (lines 193-250)
- Token cap and prioritization
- Optimization strategies

**Plan Fidelity**: Very Good
- Phase 3 implemented context builder
- Token estimation and truncation
- Query classification

**Outcome**: Context management works, costs controlled.

---

### Success 4: Magit-Inspired UI ✅

**Spec Quality**: Good
- Clear wireframe (lines 667-700)
- Section breakdown (lines 557-566)

**Plan Fidelity**: Perfect
- Phase 2 implemented exact layout
- All sections present (Head, Unstaged, Staged, Stashes, Commits)

**Outcome**: UI matches spec vision exactly.

---

### Success 5: Dangerous Operation Handling ✅

**Spec Quality**: Excellent
- Type "CONFIRM" requirement (line 424)
- List of dangerous ops (line 604)
- Security validation (lines 422-440)

**Plan Fidelity**: Perfect
- Phase 5 implemented confirmation dialog
- Validation of confirmation input
- Red borders and warnings

**Outcome**: Users protected from accidental destructive operations.

---

## Part 6: Root Cause Analysis Summary

### Planning Gaps (5 instances)

1. **Async boundaries not traced** → Runtime panic (fixed)
2. **Error strategy not unified** → Technical debt (Custom variant)
3. **Integration test timing unclear** → Bottom-up implementation issues
4. **Performance benchmarks not planned** → No automated validation
5. **First-run initialization order** → Console vs TUI decision deferred

**Pattern**: Spec focused on WHAT (features), plan focused on HOW (implementation), but neither traced cross-cutting concerns (async, errors, testing).

**Root Cause**: Missing "architectural concern" sections in spec template:
- Async execution map
- Error handling strategy
- Testing methodology
- Performance validation approach
- Initialization dependencies

---

### Specification Ambiguities (3 instances)

1. **"Create with defaults if missing"** → Unclear who creates (config.load vs wizard)
2. **Theme in config example** → Not in requirements, ambiguous intent
3. **Performance requirements** → Targets listed but testing not specified

**Pattern**: Spec listed requirements without specifying validation/implementation approach.

**Root Cause**: Requirements stated as properties ("shall be <100ms") without processes ("shall measure via criterion benchmarks").

---

### Correct Prioritizations (4 instances)

1. **Caching deferred** → Spec said "nice to know," plan correctly skipped
2. **V2 features deferred** → Spec marked explicitly, plan followed
3. **Git version validation added** → Plan improved on spec proactively
4. **Phase ordering changed** → Plan improved testability over spec suggestion

**Pattern**: Plan made intelligent trade-offs when spec guidance was high-level.

**Root Cause**: Spec empowered plan to make implementation decisions within constraints.

---

## Part 8: Spec Template Improvements

### New Sections to Add

```markdown
## Async Execution Architecture

**Purpose**: Map async/await boundaries to prevent runtime conflicts.

**Execution Context Map**:
- Entry point: `main.rs` - `#[tokio::main]` async fn main()
  - ↓ calls → `FirstRunWizard::run()` - ASYNC
    - ↓ calls → `test_api_connection()` - ASYNC
  - ↓ calls → `App::new()` - SYNC
    - ↓ calls → `App::run()` - ASYNC
      - ↓ calls → `Translator::translate()` - ASYNC

**Async Boundaries**:
- Functions marked `async`: [list]
- Tokio runtime initialization: main.rs
- No nested runtime creation allowed

---

## Error Handling Architecture

**Purpose**: Define error types and conversion paths.

**Module Errors**:
- `GitError` - git operations (src/error.rs)
- `ConfigError` - configuration (src/config/settings.rs)
- `LLMError` - LLM operations (src/llm/client.rs)
- `ValidationError` - command validation (src/security/validator.rs)

**Top-Level Error**:
- `AppError` - unified application error
- Conversion: `impl From<GitError> for AppError`
- Conversion: `impl From<ConfigError> for AppError`
- Conversion: `impl From<LLMError> for AppError`

**Error Flow**:
- Module functions return module-specific errors
- App-level functions convert to AppError
- UI displays user-friendly messages from AppError

---

## Testing Methodology

**Purpose**: Specify testing approach and tools.

**Test-Driven Development**:
- Approach: Write failing integration test first
- Implement features until test passes
- Add unit tests for edge cases

**Test Levels**:
1. Unit tests: Module-level, >85% coverage
2. Integration tests: End-to-end flows
3. Performance benchmarks: Automated regression detection

**Tools**:
- Unit testing: Built-in Rust test framework
- Benchmarking: Criterion
- Coverage: Tarpaulin or cargo-llvm-cov

**Performance Validation**:
- Benchmark: UI refresh time (target: <100ms)
- Benchmark: Startup time (target: <500ms)
- Benchmark: Memory usage (target: <100MB)
- CI: Fail build if benchmarks regress >10%

---

## Initialization Dependencies

**Purpose**: Define startup sequence and dependency order.

**Startup Sequence**:
1. Validate git version (src/git/version.rs)
2. Load config OR run first-run wizard
   - If config.toml exists → load
   - If not → FirstRunWizard::run() → create config
3. Discover git repository (Repository::discover)
4. Initialize TUI with config and repository
5. Enter event loop

**Dependencies**:
- TUI requires: Config + Repository
- FirstRunWizard requires: None (console-based)
- Config loading requires: Filesystem access
- Repository discovery requires: Git binary

**Initialization Mode**:
- First-run wizard: Console-based (pre-TUI)
- Main application: TUI-based (post-config)
- No mixing of console I/O and TUI in same phase
```

---

## Part 9: Lessons Learned

### What to Repeat

1. **Comprehensive Security Spec** ✅
   - Detailed allowlists, validation rules, audit requirements
   - Result: Zero security issues

2. **Offline Mode Design** ✅
   - Complete degradation strategy upfront
   - Result: Smooth offline UX

3. **LLM Context Strategy** ✅
   - Token budgets and escalation rules
   - Result: Cost-controlled API usage

4. **Phased Implementation** ✅
   - Each phase independently valuable
   - Result: Incremental delivery, easier testing

### What to Improve

1. **Trace Cross-Cutting Concerns** ⚠️
   - Async, errors, testing not mapped
   - Add architectural sections to spec

2. **Specify Testing Approach** ⚠️
   - TDD vs bottom-up unclear
   - Add testing methodology section

3. **Performance Validation** ⚠️
   - Requirements stated but testing not specified
   - Add benchmark requirements

4. **Clarify Ambiguous Text** ⚠️
   - "Create with defaults if missing" confused
   - Add decision records: "X is responsible for Y"

### What to Avoid

1. **Don't Mix Spec Levels** ❌
   - Theme in config example but not requirements
   - Keep examples consistent with requirements

2. **Don't Defer Architectural Decisions** ❌
   - First-run console vs TUI should be specified
   - Make architecture choices in spec, not implementation

3. **Don't Assume Testing Implicit** ❌
   - Performance benchmarks assumed obvious
   - Explicitly require all validation methods

---

## Part 10: Final Assessment

### Spec Quality: A (93/100)

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive feature coverage
- Clear security requirements
- Excellent offline mode design
- Good wireframes and examples

**Weaknesses**:
- Missing async execution map (-2)
- No error handling architecture (-2)
- Testing methodology unclear (-2)
- Initialization dependencies not specified (-1)

**Recommendation**: Add 4 new sections (async, errors, testing, init) to reach A+.

---

### Plan Quality: A- (90/100)

**Strengths**:
- Logical phase breakdown
- Comprehensive deliverables
- Good risk analysis
- Proper dependency tracking

**Weaknesses**:
- Didn't trace async boundaries (-3)
- Didn't plan unified error strategy (-3)
- Setup wizard TUI assumption (-2)
- No performance benchmarks (-2)

**Recommendation**: Add architectural validation checklist before implementation.

---

### Implementation Quality: B+ (88/100)

**Strengths**:
- All acceptance criteria met
- Good test coverage (117 tests)
- Excellent documentation
- Proper security implementation

**Weaknesses**:
- Config.load() bug (caught early) (-3)
- Async runtime panic (fixed quickly) (-3)
- GitError::Custom workaround (-2)
- No performance benchmarks (-2)
- Setup wizard deviation (-2)

**Recommendation**: Address technical debt (errors, benchmarks) in next sprint.

---

## Conclusion

**Overall Project Grade: A- (90/100)**

The spec was comprehensive and guided implementation well. The plan translated spec to actionable phases effectively. Implementation followed the plan with justified deviations and good documentation.

**Key Insight**: Most deviations were improvements (phase ordering, git version validation) or necessary adaptations (console wizard, async functions). The few issues (config bug, async panic) were caught quickly through testing and user feedback.

**Primary Learning**: Specs should include "architectural concern" sections (async, errors, testing, init) to prevent implementation surprises. These cross-cutting concerns don't fit neatly into feature descriptions but are critical for smooth implementation.

**Next Steps**: Apply fast-follow actions to both improve current codebase and enhance spec template for future features.
