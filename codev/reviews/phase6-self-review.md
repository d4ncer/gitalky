### ❌ Deviations from Plan

## Deviation 1: Missing `src/ui/setup_wizard.rs`

**Planned**: Separate TUI widget for setup wizard
**Implemented**: Console-based wizard in `src/config/first_run.rs`

### 5 Whys Analysis

**Why 1**: Why wasn't setup_wizard.rs created as a TUI widget?
- Because the first-run wizard was implemented as a console application instead of a TUI screen.

**Why 2**: Why was it implemented as a console application?
- Because the wizard needs to run before the TUI is initialized, and mixing console I/O with TUI would complicate terminal state management.

**Why 3**: Why does the wizard need to run before TUI initialization?
- Because the TUI depends on the config being loaded (via App::new(repo, config)), and the wizard creates that config.

**Why 4**: Why does the TUI need the config at initialization time?
- Because the design couples App creation with config loading - App::new() requires a Config parameter to determine LLM availability and mode.

**Why 5**: Why is the App tightly coupled to config at creation?
- Because the original design pattern assumed config would always exist, and only in Phase 6 did we add first-run experience as an afterthought.

### Root Cause
**Architectural**: The TUI initialization flow was designed before first-run experience requirements were fully considered. The plan called for a TUI-based wizard but didn't account for the chicken-and-egg problem: TUI needs config, but config is created by the wizard.

### Learning
**For Future Features**: When adding setup/configuration features:
1. Consider initialization order dependencies early in planning
2. Decide upfront: console wizard vs TUI wizard vs hybrid approach
3. Document the choice in the plan with rationale
4. If TUI-based wizard is truly needed, design App to support late config binding

### Was This Deviation Good?
**Yes**. The console-based wizard is actually superior because:
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- No terminal state conflicts
- Simpler implementation
- Better user experience (no flashing between TUI and console)
- The plan's assumption of TUI wizard was not well thought through

## Deviation 2: `Config::load()` Initially Returned Defaults

**Planned**: Load config or error if missing
**Initially Implemented**: Return `Ok(default_config())` when file doesn't exist
**Fixed**: Return error when file doesn't exist

### 5 Whys Analysis

**Why 1**: Why did Config::load() initially return defaults instead of erroring?
- Because I misunderstood the requirement and thought "create with defaults if missing" meant load() should auto-create.

**Why 2**: Why was the requirement misunderstood?
- Because the plan text "Create with defaults if missing" was ambiguous about *who* creates the defaults.

**Why 3**: Why was the plan text ambiguous?
- Because it didn't clearly specify that the wizard is responsible for creating defaults, not Config::load().

**Why 4**: Why wasn't this caught during initial implementation?
- Because I didn't test the first-run flow until after implementing the config module - implemented bottom-up instead of top-down.

**Why 5**: Why implement bottom-up instead of testing the integration first?
- Because I followed the plan's deliverable order (settings.rs first, then first_run.rs) rather than implementing end-to-end flow.

### Root Cause
**Process**: Ambiguous specification text + bottom-up implementation approach without integration testing led to misunderstanding the requirement.

### Learning
**For Future Features**:
1. Clarify ambiguous plan text before implementing (ask "who is responsible for X?")
2. Implement critical path end-to-end first, then fill in details
3. Test integration points early, not after all components are built
4. Add integration tests to the implementation checklist before moving to next component

### Was This Deviation Bad?
**Yes, but caught quickly**. The bug was discovered during manual testing and fixed within minutes. The fix was simple (return error instead of defaults).

---

## Deviation 3: Async Runtime Panic in API Validation

**Planned**: API validation with test request
**Initially Implemented**: Nested tokio runtime causing panic
**Fixed**: Async wizard methods using existing runtime

### 5 Whys Analysis

**Why 1**: Why did the API validation cause a runtime panic?
- Because FirstRunWizard::run() tried to create a tokio runtime inside an existing tokio runtime.

**Why 2**: Why was a nested runtime created?
**- Because the test_api_connection() function used `runtime.block_on()` in a synchronous context.

**Why 3**: Why was it designed as synchronous when it needs async operations?
- Because the plan showed `pub fn run()` (not async), and I followed that signature without questioning.

**Why 4**: Why didn't the plan specify async for the wizard?
- Because main.rs was already using `#[tokio::main]`, but the plan didn't consider that the wizard would be called from within that async context.

**Why 5**: Why wasn't the async context propagation considered in planning?
- Because the plan focused on individual components in isolation without analyzing the full call chain from main.rs → wizard → API validation.

### Root Cause
**Architectural**: The plan didn't trace the async execution context from entry point through to leaf functions. The wizard signature was specified without considering it would be called from an async main.

### Learning
**For Future Features**:
1. Trace execution context (sync/async) from entry point to leaf functions during planning
2. Mark async boundaries explicitly in the plan
3. When planning API calls, always consider: "where in the call chain does this live?"
4. Add async/await to function signatures in plan when they'll be called from async context

### Was This Deviation Bad?
**Yes, but instructive**. It revealed a gap in planning methodology - not considering execution context propagation. The fix (making wizard async) was straightforward once identified.

---

## Deviation 4: Added `GitError::Custom` Variant

**Planned**: Not specified
**Implemented**: Added to support error messages from config/wizard

### 5 Whys Analysis

**Why 1**: Why was GitError::Custom added?
- Because try_reconnect() needed to return GitError with custom messages about config loading.

**Why 2**: Why does try_reconnect() return GitError?
- Because it's a method on App which uses Result<(), GitError> throughout.

**Why 3**: Why wasn't this error variant planned?
- Because the plan didn't anticipate needing generic errors for config-related operations.

**Why 4**: Why weren't config errors anticipated?
- Because Phase 6 planning focused on config module errors (ConfigError) separately from App errors (GitError).

**Why 5**: Why are errors segregated by module instead of unified?
- Because error design happened incrementally per phase without a unified error strategy.

### Root Cause
**Architectural**: Lack of unified error handling strategy. Each phase added errors as needed without considering cross-module error propagation.

### Learning
**For Future Features**:
1. Design error hierarchy upfront before implementation begins
2. Consider error conversion paths between modules
3. Add a "catch-all" variant (like Custom) early if error types are segregated
4. Document error flow in the plan: "Module A errors convert to App errors via..."

### Was This Deviation Good?
**Neutral**. Adding `Custom` is a pragmatic solution, but reveals technical debt in error design. Should be refactored in future to have proper error conversion traits.

## Additional Observations

### What Went Well

1. **Incremental Testing**: Building and testing after each component prevented compounding issues
2. **User Discovery**: User caught the missing first-run wizard before I did, leading to rapid fix
3. **Documentation Quality**: README was comprehensive and well-structured
4. **Security Defaults**: Config file permissions (600) and env var preference were correctly implemented

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Integration Testing**: Should have tested end-to-end flow earlier
2. **Async Planning**: Need better methodology for planning async code paths
3. **Error Strategy**: Should plan unified error handling before implementation
4. **Deliverable Order**: Plan listed setup_wizard.rs but implementation showed it wasn't needed

### Process Insights

1. **Plan Rigidity vs Flexibility**:
   - Following plan literally (setup_wizard.rs) would have been wrong
   - Adapting to architectural reality (console wizard) was right
   - Need to distinguish between "intent" (have a wizard) and "prescription" (TUI widget)

2. **Bottom-Up vs Top-Down**:
   - Plan encouraged bottom-up (config → wizard → integration)
   - Better approach: spike end-to-end, then implement components
   - For Phase 7+: Start with integration test, then implement to pass

3. **Specification Ambiguity**:
   - "Create with defaults if missing" → who creates?
   - "API validation" → sync or async?
   - Need to ask clarifying questions during planning, not implementation

## Metrics

### Code Quality
- **Tests**: 117 unit tests passing (100%)
- **Coverage**: Config module fully tested with validation scenarios
- **Security**: File permissions, API key handling, command validation all correct

### Deviations Impact
- **Critical**: 0 (no deviations broke core functionality)
- **Major**: 2 (async panic, config load bug - both fixed)
- **Minor**: 2 (missing file, error variant - both acceptable)

### Time Impact
- **Original Plan Time**: N/A (not estimated)
- **Actual Time**: ~3 hours implementation + 1 hour bug fixes
- **Deviation Time Cost**: ~1 hour (30min async fix + 30min config fix)

## Recommendations for Future Phases

### Planning Phase
1. ✅ **Trace Async Boundaries**: Map sync/async from main() to leaves
2. ✅ **Integration First**: Define end-to-end flow before component details
3. ✅ **Clarify Ambiguities**: Add "Decision: X is responsible for Y" sections
4. ✅ **Error Strategy**: Design error hierarchy upfront

### Implementation Phase
1. ✅ **Spike Critical Path**: Implement end-to-end skeleton first
2. ✅ **Test Integration Early**: Don't wait until all components are done
3. ✅ **Question the Plan**: If something seems architecturally wrong, investigate
4. ✅ **Document Deviations**: Note why you diverged in commit messages

### Review Phase
1. ✅ **5 Whys on All Deviations**: Understand root causes, not just symptoms
2. ✅ **Extract Patterns**: Turn learnings into checklists for next phase
3. ✅ **Update Methodology**: Add new practices to SPIDER-SOLO if valuable

## Conclusion

Phase 6 was successfully delivered with all acceptance criteria met. The 4 deviations revealed valuable insights:

1. **Architectural**: TUI vs console wizard choice needs earlier consideration
2. **Process**: Bottom-up implementation hides integration issues
3. **Technical**: Async context propagation must be planned explicitly
4. **Design**: Error handling strategy needs upfront design

**Overall Grade**: B+
- Functionality: A (all features work correctly)
- Process Adherence: B (followed plan but missed integration testing)
- Learning: A (deep analysis of deviations, actionable insights)

**Key Takeaway**: Plans are guides, not gospel. When architectural reality conflicts with plan details, adapt intelligently but document why. The 5 Whys analysis shows most issues stem from planning gaps, not implementation errors - this is valuable feedback for improving future specifications.

## Action Items for Next Phase

- [ ] Add "Async Execution Context" section to planning template
- [ ] Include "Integration Test First" step in implementation checklist
- [ ] Design unified error handling strategy before Phase 7
- [ ] Create "clarifying questions" checklist for plan review
