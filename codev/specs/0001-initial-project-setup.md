# Specification: Initial Project Setup

## Metadata
- **ID**: spec-2025-09-30-initial-project-setup
- **Status**: draft
- **Created**: 2025-09-30

## Clarifying Questions Asked
<!-- This is a bootstrap specification for getting the project started -->
- What is the purpose of the gitalky project?
- What features should be prioritized?

## Problem Statement
The gitalky project is a new Rust-based Git repository analysis and interaction tool. The project needs to adopt the Codev methodology to ensure structured, specification-driven development with clear documentation and iterative improvement.

## Current State
- Basic Rust project structure exists (Cargo.toml, src/main.rs with hello world)
- No development methodology in place
- No specification or planning framework

## Desired State
- Codev methodology fully integrated
- SPIDER-SOLO protocol active
- Clear guidelines for future development
- Ready to begin feature development with structured approach

## Stakeholders
- **Primary Users**: Development team building gitalky
- **Technical Team**: Developers implementing features
- **Business Owners**: Project maintainers

## Success Criteria
- [x] Codev directory structure created
- [x] SPIDER-SOLO protocol templates available
- [x] CLAUDE.md documentation created
- [x] Initial specification created
- [ ] All documentation reviewed and approved

## Constraints
### Technical Constraints
- Rust edition 2024
- Git-based version control

### Business Constraints
- None at this stage

## Assumptions
- Team will follow SPIDER-SOLO protocol for feature development
- Self-review and human approval workflow will be followed

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: SPIDER-SOLO Protocol (Selected)
**Description**: Use the single-agent SPIDER-SOLO protocol since Zen MCP server is not available

**Pros**:
- No external dependencies required
- Self-review based workflow
- Clear phase structure with checkpoints
- Human approval at key stages

**Cons**:
- No multi-agent consultation available
- Relies more heavily on human review

**Estimated Complexity**: Low
**Risk Level**: Low

## Open Questions

### Critical (Blocks Progress)
- None

### Important (Affects Design)
- [ ] What features should be prioritized for gitalky?

### Nice-to-Know (Optimization)
- [ ] Will multi-agent consultation be available in the future?

## Performance Requirements
Not applicable for this specification.

## Security Considerations
Not applicable for this specification.

## Test Scenarios
### Functional Tests
1. Verify directory structure is correct
2. Verify protocol templates are accessible
3. Verify CLAUDE.md contains correct information

### Non-Functional Tests
Not applicable for this specification.

## Dependencies
- Codev framework (downloaded from GitHub)
- Git for version control

## Risks and Mitigation
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Team doesn't follow protocol | Low | Medium | Clear documentation and training |
| Protocol too heavyweight | Low | Low | Can skip for simple tasks per guidelines |

## Approval
- [ ] Technical Lead Review
- [ ] Stakeholder Sign-off

## Notes
This specification documents the Codev setup itself. Future features should follow the full SPIDER-SOLO protocol starting with a proper specification phase.
